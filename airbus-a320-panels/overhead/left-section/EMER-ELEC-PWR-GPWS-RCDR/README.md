# OpenA3XX ‚Äì EMER ELEC PWR / GPWS / RCDR Panel v1.0

**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì EMER ELEC PWR Control Panel**

---

## Overview

This panel replicates the **EMER ELEC PWR**, **GPWS**, and **RCDR** sections of the overhead panel found in Airbus aircraft. It includes a combination of push-button Korry-style switches for managing emergency electrical systems, ground proximity warnings, and cockpit voice recorder controls.

The hardware design includes a **PCB assembly**, **front acrylic panel**, and provisions for illumination and interaction using tactile Korry-style switches.

## Panel Layout

![Acrylic Panels](./img/acrylic-panels.png)

The panel is structured into 3 main zones:

### Top Row ‚Äì EMER ELEC PWR:

- **EMER GEN TEST**: Test pushbutton with Korry-style label.
- **GEN 1 LINE**: Switch labeled `SMOKE / OFF`.
- **RAT & EMER GEN**: Labeled `FAULT` with indicator marks.
- **MAN ON / AUTO**: Korry Switch with AUTO and MAN positions.

### Middle Row ‚Äì GPWS:

- **TERR** and **SYS**: Korry switches with `FAULT / OFF` labels.
- **G/S MODE**, **FLAP MODE**, **LDG FLAP3**: Korry-style switches with `OFF` and `ON` configurations.

### Bottom Row ‚Äì RCDR:

- **GND CTL**: Switch with `ON / AUTO` legend.
- **CVR ERASE** and **CVR TEST**: Pushbutton with circular layout indicators.

#### K1‚ÄìK10 ‚Äì Korry Switch Connectors

- Each switch has 4-pin headers for signal and illumination control.
- Labeled directly on silkscreen for ease of assembly.

#### J2, J3, J4 ‚Äì Test Switches and External Trigger Input

- 2-pin headers for discrete logic input of test switches (CVR, EMER GEN, etc.).

#### J5 ‚Äì 2-Pin Terminal Block

- Located bottom center for 12V power and GND input.
- Drives all LED backlighting and switch lighting.

---

### LEDs and Indicators

- Over 45 yellow SMD LEDs (D1‚ÄìD52) distributed around the switches and selectors for illumination.
- Paired with 220-ohm resistors (R1‚ÄìR18) for current limiting.
- Centralized switch regions and legends lit via edge LED positioning.

---

### Mounting and Assembly

- 4x corner mounting holes aligned with front acrylic plate.
- Panel is designed for sandwich-style installation with easy removal for maintenance.
- Alignment marks etched for accurate placement of:
    - Korry modules.
