# OpenA3XX ‚Äì OCRW Panel v1.0  
**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì Oxygen, Calls, Rain Repellent, and Wipers Control Panel**

---

## Overview

This OCRW panel replicates a section of the **overhead panel** in Airbus aircraft, providing controls for **oxygen systems**, **intercom/call signaling**, **rain repellent**, and **windshield wipers**.

The hardware is composed of a **PCB assembly**, **laser-etched front panel**, and integrated tactile control components including **Korry-style pushbutton switches** and a **rotary selector**.

## Panel Layout

![Acrylic Panels](./img/acrylic-panels.png)

The OCRW panel layout is logically split into functional zones:

### Top Row ‚Äì Oxygen Controls
- **HIGH ALT LANDING**
- **MASK MAN ON**
- **PASSENGER SYS ON**
- **CREW SUPPLY OFF**

Each control features:
- A rectangular Korry-style illuminated switch (with ON/OFF legends).
- Vertical "AUTO" label next to "MASK MAN ON".
- Grouped under the **OXYGEN** header with visible dividing line.

### Middle Row ‚Äì Call Buttons
Labeled under **CALLS**, these are pushbuttons for intercom signaling:
- **MECH**
- **ALL**
- **FWD**
- **AFT**
- **EMER CALL ON** (uses Korry-style illuminated switch)

Each position is marked for a circular switch or illuminated pushbutton.

### Bottom Row ‚Äì Rain and Wiper Systems
- **RAIN RPLNT**: Pushbutton location  
- **WIPER Rotary Switch**:  
  - 3 positions: `OFF`, `SLOW`, `FAST`  
  - Curved arc label with selector indentation

### LEDs and Indicators

- Yellow **SMD LEDs (D1‚ÄìD45)** for:
  - Button illumination
  - Label backlighting (e.g., AUTO, SLOW/FAST arc)
  - System ON indications

- Each LED is paired with a **current-limiting resistor (R1‚ÄìR15)**

---

### Mounting and Assembly

- **4 main mounting holes** for panel attachment (corners)
- **M3 screw spacing** compatible with front acrylic panel
- **Laser alignment holes** ensure correct positioning of:
  - Switches
  - Rotary encoders
  - Acrylic overlay

---

## Fabrication and Panel Fit

### Acrylic Faceplate

- **Engraved legends**:
  - All switch labels (e.g., HIGH ALT, MASK MAN ON, CALL ON)
  - Section titles: OXYGEN, CALLS, WIPER, RAIN RPLNT
  - Arc markings for the wiper rotary control

- **Cutouts**:
  - 6 rectangular Korry-style switches
  - 6 circular button holes
  - 1 rotary encoder (wiper switch)

- **Color Code (DXF Format)**:
  - **Red** = Front Cutouts  
  - **Blue** = Rear Cutouts  
  - **Green** = Engravings  
  - **Orange** = Korry Labels (SYS ON, CALL ON, etc.)

## PCB Design Reference

The routing view shows:
- **Red** = Top Layer Traces  
- **Blue** = Bottom Layer Traces  
- **Yellow** = Component boundaries and silkscreen  
- Mixed use of **through-hole and SMD** components:
  - Switch headers
  - LEDs
  - Resistors
  - Rotary encoder
