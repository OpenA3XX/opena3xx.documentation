# OpenA3XX ‚Äì FLT CTL Panel (CPT) v1.0  
**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì Flight Control Panel (Captain Side)**

---

## Overview

This panel replicates the **Flight Control (FLT CTL)** section of the Airbus A3XX cockpit, specifically for the captain's side. It enables simulation of control toggling for three key flight control computers:

- **ELAC1** (Elevator Aileron Computer)
- **SEC1** (Spoiler Elevator Computer)
- **FAC1** (Flight Augmentation Computer)

Each module is presented with a backlit Korry-style dual switch (`FAULT`, `OFF`) and matching legend.

## Panel Layout

This panel uses a horizontal alignment of the three control modules:

![Acrylic Panels](./img/acrylic-panels.png)

- From left to right: **ELAC1**, **SEC1**, **FAC1**
- Each module contains:
  - A square space to mount a dual Korry-style switch.
  - Surrounding white silkscreen rectangles and labels.
  - Top and bottom illumination points for the button segments.

The front panel acrylic features laser-engraved legends for each function and a centered ‚ÄúFLT CTL‚Äù label above the modules.

## PCB Details

### üîå Connectors & Interfaces

#### J1 ‚Äì 40-Pin Header (Top Left)
- Provides individual outputs for:
  - Top LED
  - Bottom LED
  - Switch state (momentary)

#### J7 ‚Äì 2-Pin Terminal Block (Bottom Center)
- Marked `+12V Variable Backlight` and `GND`
- Supplies power to the LED backlight system.

#### Korry Switch Pads
- Labeled for:
  - `TOP_LED +5V`, `TOP_LED GND`
  - `BOTTOM_LED +5V`, `BOTTOM_LED GND`
  - `SW_GND`, `SW_OUT`

Each Korry switch has its own silkscreen footprint and dedicated labeled pad for clear wiring.


| Pin | Signal           |
|-----|------------------|
| 1   | ELEC1-TOP_LED    |
| 2   | ELEC1-BOTTOM_LED |
| 3   | ELEC1-KORRY_SW   |
| 4   | SEC1-TOP_LED     |
| 5   | SEC1-BOTTOM_LED  |
| 6   | SEC1-KORRY_SW    |
| 7   | FAC1-TOP_LED     |
| 8   | FAC1-BOTTOM_LED  |
| 9   | FAC1-KORRY_SW    |

### LEDs and Indicators

- Yellow surface-mounted LEDs (D1‚ÄìD18) positioned around the three switch zones.
  - Each module has 6 LEDs to ensure uniform backlighting.
- Current-limiting resistors (R1‚ÄìR6) are positioned near the LED arrays and matched per module.

---

### Mounting and Assembly

- 2 large corner mounting holes on both sides of the PCB and acrylic panel.
- The silkscreen includes:
  - Accurate outlines for Korry switch modules.
  - Pin labels and alignment guides.
- Switches fit into center-aligned footprints with routed panel cutouts.

---

## Fabrication and Panel Fit

### Acrylic Front Panel:
- CNC-cut with legends for:
  - `FLT CTL`, `ELAC1`, `SEC1`, `FAC1`
  - Korry button text: `FAULT` (top), `OFF` (bottom)
- Color-coded DXF-like layout:
  - Red = Front Panel
  - Blue = Back Panel
  - Green = Engraving
  - Orange = Korry Labels

Acrylic cutouts align precisely with the PCB-mounted components and LEDs for consistent backlighting and tactile switch feedback.

## PCB Design Reference

![PCB Design](./img/pcb-design.png)
![PCB 3D Front](./img/pcb-3d-front.png)
![PCB 3D Back](./img/pcb-3d-back.png)

- Red traces = top copper layer  
- Blue traces = bottom copper layer  
- Yellow = component silkscreen and labels  
- White silkscreen shows connector references and legends

The board is designed for a clean signal path and simplified wiring between the 40-pin header and the three switches.
