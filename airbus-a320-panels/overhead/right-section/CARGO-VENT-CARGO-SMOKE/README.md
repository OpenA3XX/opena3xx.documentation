# OpenA3XX ‚Äì Cargo Vent & Cargo Smoke Panel v1.0  
**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì CARGO VENT & CARGO SMOKE Panel**

---

## Overview

This panel replicates the **Cargo Ventilation and Cargo Smoke Detection & Discharge controls** as found in Airbus aircraft.  
The hardware integrates both the AFT ISOL VALVE control and the CARGO SMOKE pushbuttons.

Includes:
- 1x Korry-style switch for **AFT ISOL VALVE**.
- 4x Korry-style switches for **SMOKE DISCHARGE** and indicators (FWD/REAR).
- 1x TEST pushbutton with illumination.
- Dual-section design for **CARGO VENT** and **CARGO SMOKE** functionalities.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Flight Simulation Only ‚Äì Not for use in real aviation applications.**

## LEDs and Indicators

- 42 yellow SMD LEDs labeled D1‚ÄìD42.
- Used for:
  - Illuminating Korry switch outlines.
  - Backlighting legends (DISCH, FAULT, OFF).
  - TEST button and vertical divider illumination.

Each LED has an inline 220-ohm current-limiting resistor (R1‚ÄìR14).

## Mounting and Assembly

- 4 corner holes for mounting into cockpit enclosure.
- CNC-cut acrylic matches PCB exactly.
- Includes silkscreen legends for:
  - Component IDs.
  - Alignment of Korry modules.
  - Mechanical guides.
