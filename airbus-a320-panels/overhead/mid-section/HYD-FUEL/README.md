# OpenA3XX ‚Äì HYD & FUEL Panel v1.0

**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì Hydraulic & Fuel Control Panel**

---

## Overview

This HYD & FUEL panel replicates the hydraulic and fuel system control panels found in Airbus aircraft. It includes multiple pushbutton switch modules with `FAULT` and `OFF/ON` legends, one 7-segment display zone (for RAT), and a wide range of hydraulic and fuel switches organized per system.

The design includes a **PCB**, **acrylic front panel**, and **component silk overlays** to replicate accurate cockpit hardware interaction using Korry-style switches.
