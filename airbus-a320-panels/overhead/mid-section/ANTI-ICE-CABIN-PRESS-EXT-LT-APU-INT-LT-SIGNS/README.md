# OpenA3XX – ANTI-ICE, CABIN PRESS, EXT LT, APU, INT LT, SIGNS Panel v1.0  
**Flight Simulation Hardware – Airbus Overhead Light, Environmental, and Signage Controls**

---

## Overview

This panel replicates a major section of the **Airbus A320 overhead panel**, providing simulation functionality for:

- **Anti-ice & Probe heating**
- **Cabin pressurization**
- **External lighting**
- **APU control**
- **Interior lighting**
- **Passenger information signs**

Designed for realism and full immersion in flight simulation, the hardware consists of a custom **PCB**, **Korry-style illuminated pushbuttons**, **rotary selectors**, and a **laser-etched acrylic faceplate**.

> ⚠️ **Flight Simulation Only – Not for use in real aviation applications.**

## Panel Layout

![Acrylic Panels](./img/acrylic-panels.png)

The panel is divided into functional sections for realism and usability:

---

### ANTI-ICE

- **WING** – Heats leading edges of the wings.  
- **ENG1 / ENG2** – Activates engine nacelle anti-ice for respective engine.  
- **PROBE / WINDOW HEAT** – Activates heating for pitot tubes, static ports, and windshields.  
  - Includes `AUTO` label vertically silkscreened.

All positions use **Korry-style switches**, with LED indicators (`FAULT`, `ON`).

---

### 🌬 CABIN PRESS

- **MAN V/S CTL** – Manual vertical speed control (spring-loaded switch).  
- **MODE SEL** – Switches between AUTO and MAN pressurization.  
- **LDG ELEV AUTO** – Rotary switch to set landing elevation manually when not in AUTO.  
- **DITCHING** – Closes outflow valves, air inlets, and exhaust valves to prepare for ditching.

---

### EXT LT (External Lighting)

Includes 8 pushbuttons for lighting systems:

| Switch         | Function                                  |

  - **Red** = Front Face Panel Cuts  
  - **Blue** = Rear Panel Cuts  
  - **Green** = Laser Engravings  
  - **Orange** = Korry Legends

---

## PCB Design Reference

The routing view provides:

- **Red** = Top copper traces  
- **Blue** = Bottom copper traces  
- **Yellow** = Silkscreen labels and footprints  
- **Through-hole and SMD components** co-exist for ease of assembly
