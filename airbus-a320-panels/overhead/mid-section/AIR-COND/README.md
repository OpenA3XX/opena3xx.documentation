# OpenA3XX ‚Äì AIR COND Panel v1.0  
**Flight Simulation Hardware ‚Äì Air Conditioning Control Panel**

---

## Overview

This AIR COND panel replicates the **Air Conditioning and Pneumatic Control System** panel found in Airbus aircraft. It includes controls and indicators for managing cabin airflow, temperature regulation, bleed air sources, and emergency air intake.

The design includes a **PCB assembly**, a **laser-engraved acrylic faceplate**, and multiple **Korry-style switches** with dual LEDs for FAULT and OFF states. The panel also features rotary selectors for PACK FLOW, X BLEED, and individual temperature controls for the cockpit and cabin zones.

## Panel Layout

![Acrylic Panels](./img/acrylic-panels.png)

The panel is arranged in three distinct layers of interaction zones:

### Top Row ‚Äì Rotary Selectors and Flow Control:
- **PACK FLOW Selector**
  - Positions: `LO`, `NORM`, `HI`
  - Adjusts airflow intensity.
- **COCKPIT**, **FWD CABIN**, **AFT CABIN**
  - Each zone features a rotary selector with positions ranging from `COLD` to `HOT` for temperature regulation.

### Middle Row ‚Äì Functional Routing and System Map:
- Functional silkscreen mimics the aircraft‚Äôs pneumatic system routing:
  - **PACK1** and **PACK2** lines
  - **ENG1 BLEED**, **ENG2 BLEED**
  - **RAM AIR**, **APU BLEED**, **GND HP**
  - **X BLEED** rotary selector (`SHUT`, `AUTO`, `OPEN`)
- Annotated flow diagram includes airflow arrows and zone boundaries.

### Bottom Row ‚Äì Korry Switches:
- **PACK1**, **PACK2**
  - FAULT/OFF switch indicators
- **ENG1 BLEED**, **ENG2 BLEED**
  - Dual Korry switches for each engine bleed source
- **HOT AIR**, **APU BLEED**
  - Control switches with FAULT/OFF or ON indicators
- **RAM AIR**
  - Emergency air intake, Korry switch with dual-light ON indicator
