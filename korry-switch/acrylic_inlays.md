# Acrylic Inlays

## How To Order To Be Made

## How To Make Yourself

Making the inlays is a fairly straight forward process.  
We highly reccomend making these with Acrylic and a CNC. You could technically 3D print these with a clear filament, but you would then need to paint out the back around the text by hand.  
So, although it is possible, the time and complexity of making it through 3D printing is outweighed by the speed and efficiency of making these from Acrylic.

 With this being an open source project though, we would greatly welcome a different solution for 3D printing to add to the project. If you have some ideas, please feel free to submit them in the community contribution section where the team can review it.

A nice and easy build here. Simply download the Korry switch legend DXF files. They are sperated out into different sections of the aircraft so you can easily find the one\(s\) you need.  
Get a sheet of 2mm cast acrylic \(do not use extruded acrylic!\) and paint one side of it matt black.  
Then it's simply a case of inputting the DXF file into your CNC software and telling it to engrave the text first, then cut out the piece.  
You can do as many \(or few\) as you need in one cut.  
We recommend making them in this order as it is the most straight foward and means you won't have to worry about aligning the parts for engraving on a second pass.

## Step-by-step with Estlcam

Our CNC software of choice is Estlcam. You can find out more about it in the [CNC Introduction](../cnc-milling/intro.md) page.  
There are many other solutions out there, and we are in no way affiliated with Estlcam.  
It is free to use with some waiting limitations, but you can support the developer by paying a small fee and remove the waiting limitations.  
With that said, here is a step-by-step guide to making the acrylic inlays using Estlcam.

Step-by-step guide will be uploaded here soon. It is still currently under development.
