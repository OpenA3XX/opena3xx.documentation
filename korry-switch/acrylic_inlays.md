# Acrylic Inlays

## How To Order To Be Made

If you do not have access to your own CNC machine, you can always send off for the parts to be made.  
There are numerous companies out there that will machine parts for you. Cost varies depending on the material and size etc, but it is a possible solution.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need to remember that one side needs to be painted black **BEFORE** the engraving. Please check with the company that this can be done before placing an order.
{% endhint %}

You need to ask for it to made with 2mm clear acrylic. Remember to ask for one side to be painted black before it's cut.  
Simply send the company the required DXF file and they should be able to do the rest.

### Order From OpenA3XX

We are considering the possibility of holding stock of some items such as these acrylic inlays that might be slightly more difficult for people to get their hands on. This is not something we currently offer, but if we recieve enough interest on this then we will put the service in place. If this is something you would like, please let us know. The best place to do this is on the 'Suggestions' channel in the [Discord.](https://discord.gg/55aufspsDs)

## How To Make Yourself

Making the inlays is a fairly straight forward process.  
We highly reccomend making these with Acrylic and a CNC. You could technically 3D print these with a clear filament, but you would then need to paint out the back around the text by hand.  
So, although it is possible, the time and complexity of making it through 3D printing is outweighed by the speed and efficiency of making these from Acrylic.

 With this being an open source project though, we would greatly welcome a different solution for 3D printing to add to the project. If you have some ideas, please feel free to submit them in the community contribution section where the team can review it.

A nice and easy build here. Simply download the Korry switch legend DXF files. They are sperated out into different sections of the aircraft so you can easily find the one\(s\) you need.  
Get a sheet of 2mm cast acrylic \(do not use extruded acrylic!\) and paint one side of it matt black.  
Then it's simply a case of inputting the DXF file into your CNC software and telling it to engrave the text first, then cut out the piece.  
You can do as many \(or few\) as you need in one cut.  
We recommend making them in this order as it is the most straight foward and means you won't have to worry about aligning the parts for engraving on a second pass.

## Step-by-step with Estlcam

Our CNC software of choice is Estlcam. You can find out more about it in the [CNC Introduction](../cnc-milling/intro.md) page.  
There are many other solutions out there, and we are in no way affiliated with Estlcam.  
It is free to use with some waiting limitations, but you can support the developer by paying a small fee and remove the waiting limitations.  
With that said, here is a step-by-step guide to making the acrylic inlays using Estlcam.

Step-by-step guide will be uploaded here soon. It is still currently under development.
