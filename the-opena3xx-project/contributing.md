## How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project!  
There are many ways you can help, whether it's coding, design, 3D modeling, social media, documentation, and more.

The first step is to fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  
You can then make changes as you see fit. When you're ready, submit a pull request. The team will review your work and either suggest improvements or merge it into the main repository.
